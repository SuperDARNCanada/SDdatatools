# Create classes containing constants that the script will need.


# The constants are defined at class-level and not module-level.
# I know this is not PEP8 style however, it is a prefferred
# method to keep seperation, readibility, and if the coder wants to
# create errors on attempts to change the constants they can do it in the class.
